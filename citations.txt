What I prompted:
Can you help me come up with a filter idea?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
What response I recieved:
Gave me ideas on what to do for different types of filters like grayScale, invert/negative, 
only one color channel, and posterize. I then modified this "grayScale" idea to create
a grayFilter.
